# Bitcoin News Impact Analysis
## Project Overview
Bitcoin News Impact Analysis.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook designed to explore how Bitcoin's price and trading volume respond to market events, 
using time-stamped price, volume, and associated news titles. While the dataset includes news headlines, 
this notebook does not perform text or sentiment analysis â€” instead, it focuses on data-driven impact metrics, 
including price volatility and volume shifts, correlated with event timing.

# Key Goals
- Clean and preprocess raw time-series data.
- Calculate price and volume changes around news timestamps.
- Identify days with high market activity or volatility.
- Visualize Bitcoin price and volume trends across time.
